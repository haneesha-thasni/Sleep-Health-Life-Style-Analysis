  - Insomnia: The individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
  
  -Sleep Apnea: The individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.

## Objectives
* To identify trends and correlations between sleep duration and lifestyle choices.
* To provide insights that can promote better sleep health.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

#### In conclusion, our analysis of the dataset on sleep health and lifestyle reveals significant insights into how various factors, such as age and daily habits, influence sleep duration and quality. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene and making informed lifestyle choices can lead to improved overall well-being. I encourage everyone to reflect on their own sleep patterns and consider implementing some of the strategies discussed today to enhance their sleep quality. Thank you for your attention, and Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions you may have.
